**Submission deadline:** Friday, 22 March 2019 (23:59 AoE)

**Author notification:** Friday, 5 April 2019

**Camera ready deadline:** Monday, 29 April 2019 (23:59 AoE)

**Workshop:** Monday, 6 May 2019

You may submit your paper through **CMT**, by following [this link](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/RLGM2019/).

We encourage submissions to our workshop on topics related to graph and manifold representation learning. We will especially appreciate submissions that connect directly with the topic of the workshop, as well as papers that introduce relevant benchmark datasets, challenges and competitions.

Submissions should be extended abstracts of no more than 4 pages (not including references or supplementary materials). We request and recommend that authors rely on the supplementary material only to include minor details (e.g., hyperparameter settings) that do not fit in the 4 pages.

All submissions must use the [**ICLR template**](https://github.com/ICLR/Master-Template/archive/ICLR2019.tar.gz). 
Submissions should be in `.pdf` format, and the review process is **double-blind**---therefore the papers should be appropriately anonymised. Previously published work (or under-review) is acceptable. 

Accepted work will be presented as posters during the workshop and listed on this website. Additionally, a small number of papers will be selected to be presented as spotlight talks during the workshop.
